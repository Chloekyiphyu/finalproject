	<h1>Hi, this is Aurora's Journey Website</h1>
	<p>All her life, Aurora has been trapped as an art on the walls of the streets of Rome. The only thing she had wanted in this lifetime was to escape the wall and rome the world freely. Everyday, she would see people enjoying the nature with their beloved ones. She yearned the same thing, to be loved and to love. Every night, she dreamed of travelling the world, feel the rain, sun and snow. Snow, she had never seen it before. How she wished to see the snow at least once, in her life.</p>
